# Writing Without Bullshit

Below are notes per chapter on my reading of Writing Without Bullshit by Josh Bernoff

## Chapter 1 - Transcend Bullshit
The premise of writing without Bullshit is to uphold the Iron Imperative:

# Treat the reader's time as more valuable than your own time

## Chapter 2 - Sieze Your Opportunity

This is necessary since in our day and age readers are often spending more time on screens which is a lot different than reading printed word. As such, there is also a lack of editing process for emails or blogs. Content creators who write email or blog articles typically learned how to write by creating introductory, supporting, and conclusion paragraphs. Without editors and with eyes constantly glued on screen, we must value our reader's time and ensure we giving them the information they need, not wasting it. This gives every writer the opportunity to write what they mean to who needs to hear it.

## Chapter 3 - Move Beyond Fear
A great way to start this is to write without fear. Dot not be afraid to say what you mean, and be as direct as possible. This can be accomplished by avoiding:

- noncommittal subject lines: refusing to clearly state the purpose of the email or article title
- Avoiding slow but ominous warm ups: refusing to clearly state why you're writing the email or blog article and instead warming up to it with some kind of introductory paragraph.
- Head Fakes: using words to lead the readers direction in a specific direction only to reverse direction because, as the writer, you were too afraid to say it outright.
- Passive Evasions: Refusing to place blame or credit where it is due and instead using passive language to avoid it altogether.
- Weasel words: words like "generally", "considerable", "typically" are just filler unless associated with a specific statistic.
- "friendly" closing: is unnecessary in a business environment and just wastes the readers time.

The idea, ultimately, is to be direct about what you're saying, no warm ups or warm downs necessary, and state your evidence directly. There is also no need to avoid stating blame or giving credit, as only facts are being used. As the writer, you must 'move beyond fear' in order to write boldly and directly, and say what you mean.

## Chapter 4 - Write Short

A helpful way to ensure you are cutting bullshit out of your writing is by simply writing short. By simply excluding introductory or conclusionary paragraph or statements and avoiding jargon or weasel words, you can cut down on a lot of meaningless clutter in your writting. You can also shorten your writing by:

- Editing Everything: through editing, you can cutdown on redundant statements or words which distract the reader from the message.
- Aim for a word count: Through practice, its possible to find general word counts for the type of message you're writing, and learn to, through words, portray your message accurately.
- Say what you really mean: similar to move beyond fear, it is important to be direct, excluding weasel words and needless jargon to ensure you are as direct to your audience as possible.
- Start Boldly: Avoid introductory statements or paragraphs and speak your purpose outright.
- Organize Relentlessly: Ensure you are not duplicating material to your audience and putting it in an order that does not read well. Organize your writing in logical steps.
- Prune sections and arguments: Cut off the parts which don't flow well or are indirect. Remove incorrect or unnecessary statistics.
- Use bullets or tables: breaking up your writing into sections via tables and bullets helps ensure engagement and makes reading easier.
- Use graphics: similar to bullets and tables, placing all your writing into a simple table and organizing your writing ensures the message gets across in an easier to read fashion.
- Trim Connective Tissue: most sentences do not need to be connected with phrases like "therefore" and just clutter the message for the audience.
- Avoid Weasel words and qualifiers: These statements generalize your meaning rather than keeping it specific and direct. These words also increase length and clutter your writing.

Leveraging these techniques will ensure you can shorten your writing as much as possible and maintain being as direct as possible with your audience.

## Chapter 5 - Front-Load your writing

In being direct, an important thing you can do for your writing is to front-load your writing. That is, put as much information up front to both capture your reader's attention and give them the information you want. This technique looks different depending on your purpose for writing, so here are some tips to keep in mind when writing through these mediums:

- Emails: Front load the subject line and opening statement so that readers both know if the email is important and if it contains information relevant to them.
- Documents: Front load the title and the opening statement so your reader knows what they are about to read and gets as much information to hook them upfront as possible.
- Blog posts: Write a title that both intrigue both people and google. You want your blog posts to capture the interest of your intended audience both if it was handed to them directly and if they are routed through google.

## Chapter 6 - Purge Passive Voice

A passive sentence is one where the subject is not the actor performing the action and starts with the noun that the action is done to. Missing the actor obscures the meaning of sentences and confuses the reader as to 'who' was, is, or will be responsible for what did, is, or will happen. This ends up an issue as it obscures who should be responsible or will be responsible when mentioning why sales might of gone up or who will be handling a new upcoming feature.

The solution here is to know when you're looking at a passive sentence, and avoiding writing them when possible. As you get used to this idea, you can retrain yourself to write in an active voice. Placing responsibility where needed to ensure clarity in your writing.

## Chapter 7 - Replace Jargon

Jargon typically obscures meaning by making your writing harder to comprehend. By adding more sophistication you are sacrificing clarity. This writing style is purposeful in school papers and research papers, but unecessary in emails and blog posts. 

Typically jargon is written due to insider bias, where you're so used to using these terms and know the domain so well that you forget plenty of people do not. Using this jargon divides your audience and obscures meaning to those who do not know the jargon. You may fall victim to insider bias for these reasons:

- Precision: You'll try to be precise and in doing so use uncommon language to most readers.
- Efficiency: Trying to be efficient by using larger words instead of many smaller worlds, ultimately making meaning more difficult for those of smaller vocabularies.
- Corporate Cheerleading: Using corporate or leadership jargon just to show you understand what they're speaking about.
- Inflation: Simply using bigger words to sound smarter or more intelligent.

To avoid writing jargon, you'll want to visualize ahead of time who your audience are, and ensure you write in terms they'll understand. If you don't, you'll end up rewriting the jargon out of your work through editting. It is important to acknowledge when you're using jargon to ensure you either don't use it upfront or that it gets editted out.

Not all jargon is bad, however it is important to use jargon sparingly. Some topics require domain knowledge in order for them to make any sense. Here are a couple reasons to use jargon:

- Using terminology your audience understand but those outside your audience do not. If you are certain your intended audience knows your jargon, it is fine to use it.
- If a term has a specific legally required definition, use the term after defining it.
- If there is a term you want to use throughout your document, define it upfront and then proceed to use it.

## Chapter 8 - Eliminate Weasel Words

A weasel word is an adjective, adverb, or noun that indicates quantity or intensity but lacks precision. These words are problems because on the surface they add intensity or meaning to your sentences but ultimately mean nothing to the reader as they lack the precision to do so. You are left with phrases or sentences comprised of fluff.

Weasel words find their way into your writing because you want to make a statement but are unsure of its certainty, so you add weasel words to sound 'pretty' correct without it being a true or false statement. To avoid this, you can write boldly and factually. If you do not know to what amount something was affected, do not use a weasel word to approximate, and if you feel a value is necessary, find a statistical value which accurately tells what you're looking for. It is also acceptable to approximate when the chance of being incorrect is marginal, however your readers will know and remember if you end up incorrect, and is better to be avoided.

## Chapter 9 - Be Direct

When writing, it is best to speak directly to your audience. To this end, using "you" where possible is preferred to be as direct as possible and maintain an active voice. It is also not a problem to often state your opinions and say "I". This isn't true of school papers, but is true for buisness content you put out. Stating what you know is important for your own writing.

It is also acceptable to write with "we" when you need to show you're a part of a team. Showing you're involved and indicating when information affects the team are important should be written to inform your team of such.

You can ensure you're being direct by ensuring you know exactly who your audience is and then writing to them directly.

## Chapter 10 - Use Numbers Wisely.

Numbers and statistical data are important to use, however be sure you use them correctly. In a vaccum, numbers are meaningless. With context, numbers are meaningful. These techniques help when providing numbers:

- Always compare numbers to something familiar: this will ensure the reader knows the relevance to the values being provided.
- Give us historical context: the numbers provided will make more sense when a history of values (or a value) are provided.
- Don't publish growth rates with a base: It matters not how much something has grown if you haven't stated where it started.

When providing numbers to show casuality, ensure you're making a proper case. Coincidences happen, and you want to show your beliefs upfront. This can be done by:

- Stating your case and your perspective
- Citing your numbers with their context
- Citing your supporting evidence.
- Evaluating competing explanations
- Explaining how to test your conclusion.
- Explaining what to do about what you've found.

The above techniques will help show why different numbers or statistical values may be related.

It is also important to be precise as necessary to your audience. Decimals are important but too many decimals are only important to scientists. Use the following to ensure your numbers are not too precise:

- Don't show more than three significant digits: This just takes up space and gives no extra information
- Don't show more digits than you know: You lose precision and become questionable when you add decimal places you can't guarantee
- Cite growth rates of percentages properly: Reference your base and your growth and state the difference accordingly, don't state the growth in a vaccum.

Do not let personal bias affect your belief of what numbers mean. It is not your place to determine what the numbers could mean but what they are. It is also important to scrutinize how numbers you found came about. Ensuring you know where numbers can from can be accomplished in a few steps:

- Is there a source you can check?: Ensure the numbers you're pulling have a valid source.
- If there is a source, is it methodologically sound?: Make sure the studies done make sense and the numbers seem appropriate.
- What is the sample size?: Ensure a large enough sample size for the numbers to be accurate.
- Is it up-to-date?: Use up to date figures so you're as current and accurate as possible.

## Chapter 11 - Reveal Structure

It is important to ensure your document has the proper structure to make sense and respect your reader's time by not repeating any information or flow properly and logically. This can be done by ensuring proper structure. There are a few techniques to accomplish this:

- Use short Dcouments: Not everything needs to be a paragraph. Do not be afraid to write short documents or couple sentence chunks as needed.
- Chunk content with headings, bullets, and lists: break your meaning into chunks with headings and then list or bullet your details within those chunks as needed
- Insert headings as guideposts: Headings should keep you up to date with where you are in a reading after you've been informed where your writing should take you.
- Create at most two head levels: Don't get caught up in many layers in your writing as doing so will obscure the organization of your writing. Keep it simple.
- Embrace lists to ease navigation: Lists can help show information in a logical or sequential order, making an easily organized section of your document.

Where possible, use graphics to reinforce meaning in what you're saying. Graphics can also be used to clear the need to overly explain as well. Reasons to use graphics are as follows:

- Graphics and text are parallel ways of representing meaning: When working together, graphics and text can help reinforce meaning and add clarity.
- Keep it Simple: diagrams should be easy to read and simple to understand.
- Graphics escape their containers and roam the web freely: Graphics should contain all the information they need without help from text so that out of context of your document, your graphics still make sense.

Using Tables and other ways to organize your text outside of graphics can also help add clarity to your document. Leverage the tools available to you for the medium you're writing in. An example of this is to ensure you add links and quotes with sources in your document or email.

## Chapter 12 - Be Paranoid Early

You should be paranoid about your writing early. Knowing it is breaking too many rules of writing without bullshit. Ensuring you're writing without bullshit can be accomplished with a disciplined process:

1) Prepare ("Be Paranoid Early") 
    - Do you have a clear audience and objectives?
    - Do you have enough content?
    - Have you taken the most creative approach?
    - What is your structure?
    
2) Draft ("Find Your Flow")
    - Accept your document won't be done and create a rough draft
3) Revise ("Manage Reviews Effectively")
    - Find individuals to proof read your document and ensure you cut the bullshit out of it.
    
Most of the time should be spent preparing and being paranoid early. Be conscous of how little time you have to get your material, content, and supporting information together. The final phases take considerably less time.

## Chapter 13 - Think First

Thinking first is necessary in order to ensure proper planning. The Acronym to remember is:

R - Readers - Figure out your Audience
O - Objective - How will you change the reader?
A - Action - What do you want the reader to do?
M - iMpression - What will the reader think of you?

Together this should come together in an objective statement where you are able to identify your reader, give them an objective they take a desired action on, leaving a desired impression. The example sentence should look like:

" After reading this piece, [readers] will realize [objective], so they will [desired action] and think of me/us as [desired impression].

Roam is not a static statement, meaning it is meant to change as your document evolves. Ensure to revise your ROAM statement constantly and consistently.
