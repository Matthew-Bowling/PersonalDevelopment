# Writing Without Bullshit

Below are notes per chapter on my reading of Writing Without Bullshit by Josh Bernoff

## Chapter 1 - Transcend Bullshit
The premise of writing without Bullshit is to uphold the Iron Imperative:

# Treat the reader's time as more valuable than your own time

## Chapter 2 - Sieze Your Opportunity

This is necessary since in our day and age readers are often spending more time on screens which is a lot different than reading printed word. As such, there is also a lack of editing process for emails or blogs. Content creators who write email or blog articles typically learned how to write by creating introductory, supporting, and conclusion paragraphs. Without editors and with eyes constantly glued on screen, we must value our reader's time and ensure we giving them the information they need, not wasting it. This gives every writer the opportunity to write what they mean to who needs to hear it.

## Chapter 3 - Move Beyond Fear
A great way to start this is to write without fear. Dot not be afraid to say what you mean, and be as direct as possible. This can be accomplished by avoiding:

- noncommittal subject lines: refusing to clearly state the purpose of the email or article title
- Avoiding slow but ominous warm ups: refusing to clearly state why you're writing the email or blog article and instead warming up to it with some kind of introductory paragraph.
- Head Fakes: using words to lead the readers direction in a specific direction only to reverse direction because, as the writer, you were too afraid to say it outright.
- Passive Evasions: Refusing to place blame or credit where it is due and instead using passive language to avoid it altogether.
- Weasel words: words like "generally", "considerable", "typically" are just filler unless associated with a specific statistic.
- "friendly" closing: is unnecessary in a business environment and just wastes the readers time.

The idea, ultimately, is to be direct about what you're saying, no warm ups or warm downs necessary, and state your evidence directly. There is also no need to avoid stating blame or giving credit, as only facts are being used. As the writer, you must 'move beyond fear' in order to write boldly and directly, and say what you mean.

## Chapter 4 - Write Short

A helpful way to ensure you are cutting bullshit out of your writing is by simply writing short. By simply excluding introductory or conclusionary paragraph or statements and avoiding jargon or weasel words, you can cut down on a lot of meaningless clutter in your writting. You can also shorten your writing by:

- Editing Everything: through editing, you can cutdown on redundant statements or words which distract the reader from the message.
- Aim for a word count: Through practice, its possible to find general word counts for the type of message you're writing, and learn to, through words, portray your message accurately.
- Say what you really mean: similar to move beyond fear, it is important to be direct, excluding weasel words and needless jargon to ensure you are as direct to your audience as possible.
- Start Boldly: Avoid introductory statements or paragraphs and speak your purpose outright.
- Organize Relentlessly: Ensure you are not duplicating material to your audience and putting it in an order that does not read well. Organize your writing in logical steps.
- Prune sections and arguments: Cut off the parts which don't flow well or are indirect. Remove incorrect or unnecessary statistics.
- Use bullets or tables: breaking up your writing into sections via tables and bullets helps ensure engagement and makes reading easier.
- Use graphics: similar to bullets and tables, placing all your writing into a simple table and organizing your writing ensures the message gets across in an easier to read fashion.
- Trim Connective Tissue: most sentences do not need to be connected with phrases like "therefore" and just clutter the message for the audience.
- Avoid Weasel words and qualifiers: These statements generalize your meaning rather than keeping it specific and direct. These words also increase length and clutter your writing.

Leveraging these techniques will ensure you can shorten your writing as much as possible and maintain being as direct as possible with your audience.

## Chapter 5 - Front-Load your writing

In being direct, an important thing you can do for your writing is to front-load your writing. That is, put as much information up front to both capture your reader's attention and give them the information you want. This technique looks different depending on your purpose for writing, so here are some tips to keep in mind when writing through these mediums:

- Emails: Front load the subject line and opening statement so that readers both know if the email is important and if it contains information relevant to them.
- Documents: Front load the title and the opening statement so your reader knows what they are about to read and gets as much information to hook them upfront as possible.
- Blog posts: Write a title that both intrigue both people and google. You want your blog posts to capture the interest of your intended audience both if it was handed to them directly and if they are routed through google.

## Chapter 6 - Purge Passive Voice

A passive sentence is one where the subject is not the actor performing the action and starts with the noun that the action is done to. Missing the actor obscures the meaning of sentences and confuses the reader as to 'who' was, is, or will be responsible for what did, is, or will happen. This ends up an issue as it obscures who should be responsible or will be responsible when mentioning why sales might of gone up or who will be handling a new upcoming feature.

The solution here is to know when you're looking at a passive sentence, and avoiding writing them when possible. As you get used to this idea, you can retrain yourself to write in an active voice. Placing responsibility where needed to ensure clarity in your writing.

## Chapter 7 - Replace Jargon

Jargon typically obscures meaning by making your writing harder to comprehend. By adding more sophistication you are sacrificing clarity. This writing style is purposeful in school papers and research papers, but unecessary in emails and blog posts. 

Typically jargon is written due to insider bias, where you're so used to using these terms and know the domain so well that you forget plenty of people do not. Using this jargon divides your audience and obscures meaning to those who do not know the jargon. You may fall victim to insider bias for these reasons:

- Precision: You'll try to be precise and in doing so use uncommon language to most readers.
- Efficiency: Trying to be efficient by using larger words instead of many smaller worlds, ultimately making meaning more difficult for those of smaller vocabularies.
- Corporate Cheerleading: Using corporate or leadership jargon just to show you understand what they're speaking about.
- Inflation: Simply using bigger words to sound smarter or more intelligent.

To avoid writing jargon, you'll want to visualize ahead of time who your audience are, and ensure you write in terms they'll understand. If you don't, you'll end up rewriting the jargon out of your work through editting. It is important to acknowledge when you're using jargon to ensure you either don't use it upfront or that it gets editted out.

Not all jargon is bad, however it is important to use jargon sparingly. Some topics require domain knowledge in order for them to make any sense. Here are a couple reasons to use jargon:

- Using terminology your audience understand but those outside your audience do not. If you are certain your intended audience knows your jargon, it is fine to use it.
- If a term has a specific legally required definition, use the term after defining it.
- If there is a term you want to use throughout your document, define it upfront and then proceed to use it.

## Chapter 8 - Eliminate Weasel Words

A weasel word is an adjective, adverb, or noun that indicates quantity or intensity but lacks precision. These words are problems because on the surface they add intensity or meaning to your sentences but ultimately mean nothing to the reader as they lack the precision to do so. You are left with phrases or sentences comprised of fluff.

Weasel words find their way into your writing because you want to make a statement but are unsure of its certainty, so you add weasel words to sound 'pretty' correct without it being a true or false statement. To avoid this, you can write boldly and factually. If you do not know to what amount something was affected, do not use a weasel word to approximate, and if you feel a value is necessary, find a statistical value which accurately tells what you're looking for. It is also acceptable to approximate when the chance of being incorrect is marginal, however your readers will know and remember if you end up incorrect, and is better to be avoided.

## Chapter 9 - Be Direct

When writing, it is best to speak directly to your audience. To this end, using "you" where possible is preferred to be as direct as possible and maintain an active voice. It is also not a problem to often state your opinions and say "I". This isn't true of school papers, but is true for buisness content you put out. Stating what you know is important for your own writing.

It is also acceptable to write with "we" when you need to show you're a part of a team. Showing you're involved and indicating when information affects the team are important should be written to inform your team of such.

You can ensure you're being direct by ensuring you know exactly who your audience is and then writing to them directly.

## Chapter 10 - Use Numbers Wisely.

Numbers and statistical data are important to use, however be sure you use them correctly. In a vaccum, numbers are meaningless. With context, numbers are meaningful. These techniques help when providing numbers:

- Always compare numbers to something familiar: this will ensure the reader knows the relevance to the values being provided.
- Give us historical context: the numbers provided will make more sense when a history of values (or a value) are provided.
- Don't publish growth rates with a base: It matters not how much something has grown if you haven't stated where it started.

When providing numbers to show casuality, ensure you're making a proper case. Coincidences happen, and you want to show your beliefs upfront. This can be done by:

- Stating your case and your perspective
- Citing your numbers with their context
- Citing your supporting evidence.
- Evaluating competing explanations
- Explaining how to test your conclusion.
- Explaining what to do about what you've found.

The above techniques will help show why different numbers or statistical values may be related.

It is also important to be precise as necessary to your audience. Decimals are important but too many decimals are only important to scientists. Use the following to ensure your numbers are not too precise:

- Don't show more than three significant digits: This just takes up space and gives no extra information
- Don't show more digits than you know: You lose precision and become questionable when you add decimal places you can't guarantee
- Cite growth rates of percentages properly: Reference your base and your growth and state the difference accordingly, don't state the growth in a vaccum.

Do not let personal bias affect your belief of what numbers mean. It is not your place to determine what the numbers could mean but what they are. It is also important to scrutinize how numbers you found came about. Ensuring you know where numbers can from can be accomplished in a few steps:

- Is there a source you can check?: Ensure the numbers you're pulling have a valid source.
- If there is a source, is it methodologically sound?: Make sure the studies done make sense and the numbers seem appropriate.
- What is the sample size?: Ensure a large enough sample size for the numbers to be accurate.
- Is it up-to-date?: Use up to date figures so you're as current and accurate as possible.

## Chapter 11 - Reveal Structure

It is important to ensure your document has the proper structure to make sense and respect your reader's time by not repeating any information or flow properly and logically. This can be done by ensuring proper structure. There are a few techniques to accomplish this:

- Use short Dcouments: Not everything needs to be a paragraph. Do not be afraid to write short documents or couple sentence chunks as needed.
- Chunk content with headings, bullets, and lists: break your meaning into chunks with headings and then list or bullet your details within those chunks as needed
- Insert headings as guideposts: Headings should keep you up to date with where you are in a reading after you've been informed where your writing should take you.
- Create at most two head levels: Don't get caught up in many layers in your writing as doing so will obscure the organization of your writing. Keep it simple.
- Embrace lists to ease navigation: Lists can help show information in a logical or sequential order, making an easily organized section of your document.

Where possible, use graphics to reinforce meaning in what you're saying. Graphics can also be used to clear the need to overly explain as well. Reasons to use graphics are as follows:

- Graphics and text are parallel ways of representing meaning: When working together, graphics and text can help reinforce meaning and add clarity.
- Keep it Simple: diagrams should be easy to read and simple to understand.
- Graphics escape their containers and roam the web freely: Graphics should contain all the information they need without help from text so that out of context of your document, your graphics still make sense.

Using Tables and other ways to organize your text outside of graphics can also help add clarity to your document. Leverage the tools available to you for the medium you're writing in. An example of this is to ensure you add links and quotes with sources in your document or email.

## Chapter 12 - Be Paranoid Early

You should be paranoid about your writing early. Knowing it is breaking too many rules of writing without bullshit. Ensuring you're writing without bullshit can be accomplished with a disciplined process:

1) Prepare ("Be Paranoid Early") 
    - Do you have a clear audience and objectives?
    - Do you have enough content?
    - Have you taken the most creative approach?
    - What is your structure?
    
2) Draft ("Find Your Flow")
    - Accept your document won't be done and create a rough draft
3) Revise ("Manage Reviews Effectively")
    - Find individuals to proof read your document and ensure you cut the bullshit out of it.
    
Most of the time should be spent preparing and being paranoid early. Be conscous of how little time you have to get your material, content, and supporting information together. The final phases take considerably less time.

## Chapter 13 - Think First

Thinking first is necessary in order to ensure proper planning. The Acronym to remember is:

R - Readers - Figure out your Audience
O - Objective - How will you change the reader?
A - Action - What do you want the reader to do?
M - iMpression - What will the reader think of you?

Together this should come together in an objective statement where you are able to identify your reader, give them an objective they take a desired action on, leaving a desired impression. The example sentence should look like:

" After reading this piece, [readers] will realize [objective], so they will [desired action] and think of me/us as [desired impression].

Roam is not a static statement, meaning it is meant to change as your document evolves. Ensure to revise your ROAM statement constantly and consistently.

## Chapter 14 - Plan Purposefully

When planning, you want to plan purposefully, meaning to have specific items you're planning, researching, investigating, etc. A good place to start is figuring a title and to just start writing an initial paragraph. This gets the important parts out of the way and works your mind to the write place.

Its important after this to create a research plan. A good way to ensure both what you plan to research and how is to create a spreadsheet. This spreadsheet would contain the kind of research, company, last and first name, a status, and date of last contact. Some tips for contacting people:

- Send individual emails, not mass emails: people tend to ignore mass emails and will be more willing to respond to individual emails. This also allows you to customize each email appropriately.
- Use Facebook, Twitter, or LinkedIn messages as alternate contact channels: it is often easier for people to respond to messages than emails.
- Have interview questions ready ahead of time: The time of who you're contacting is valuable, so have your questions ready to go.
- Keep good records to make follow-up and fact-checking easier: be able to give copies of the interview to those you interview, and be sure you can contact them if you need them for anything further.

Making a fat outline is incredibly important in fleshing out the format of your writing and outlining key points. A fat outline should include chapters with paragraphs of content. This content is not the full chapter but leaves enough information to know the general layout of the chapter and what information will go where. This allows you to revise your work as you go without too many problems as to where to go with your writing.

## Chapter 15 - Unleash Creativity

Creativity is key to any worthwhile piece of writing. a few ways to unleash your creativity:

- Embrace your frustration: If something repeatedly frustrates you, there is typically a solution to the problem itself that you're able to solve for once you learn to embrace it and not remain frustrated.
- Turn your world upside down: Imagining the world slightly different with various circumstances on what you're considering gives you a different idea to think on which can help creativity.
- Get a new perspective: speak with various friends and family and get different perspectives on things. These perspectives could inspire your writing.
- Stop working for a minute: taking breaks is a healthy thing to do and also helps create inspiration.

Expanding your mind through conversations, articles, and concepts allows you to be open to new ways of thinking and helps push your creativity forward.

## Chapter 16 - Find Flow

When writing you want to be in a flow state so that you can focus on your writing and write at a high level. Flow is of being productive and in the moment, making rapid progress on work that matches well to your skills, and happens as you're able to accomplish progress towards a specific goal. This state has you so immersed in what you're doing you forget yourself and your surroundings.

To help create a flow, you'll want to ensure a few things: time, space, silence, fuel, content. You want to ensure you have the time needed to enter a flow state, about 90 minutes of no interruptions. Space and silence, where you're able to exist and not be bothered or distracted. Fuel is needed to ensure your brain is able to concentrate and have the energy to do so without stress. Be able to access content as needed and answer questions that arise during writing. Most importantly, turn your phone off to ensure you're able to do all of this without distractions or pauses.

When you fail to find your flow, a good way to resolve this issue is to take a stroll, go for a bike ride, or find something relaxing to do that you enjoy. Try to accomplish some work, and if need be, relax your mind before you try again. This is a constant process that you'll have to work with as you learn how to find yourself in a flow state.

## Chapter 17 - Collaborate Without Tears

Writing requires collaborating, specifically with editors. There are a few roles you can expect to find when going through a business writing process:

- Editors and Project Managers: These individuals are with you throughout the entire writing process. Editors check your writing every step of the way for various reasons, while project managers ensure your writing stays on a timeline and that you're meeting that timeline.
- Researchers and Contributors: Theese individuals are useful during your research phase and help you gather the information you need to fill out your writing.
- Advisory Reviewers: These individuals help you with new ideas, structure, or content knowledge.
- Gatekeeping Reviewers: individuals who do a review for either legal or regulatory reasons.
- Copy Editors and Fact-Checkers: These individuals do final reviews and fact check your writing to ensure you are accurate and grammatically correct.

Useful tools when collaborating would be having a shared folder, such as a google drive or dropbox. You should also use a collaboration document such as Microsoft Word or Google Docs. You should also use a naming convention and not email files. This ensures you know which version is correct and that editors don't do a run through of an incorrect version.

Working with a coauthor is an easy thing to do if you take care of the leg work upfront. Be sure to work them and find out what your collective writing should look like. Use a ROAM statement, figure out the fat outline, and be sure to layout the writing ahead of time so there are no surprises down the road.

## Chapter 18 - Embrace Edits

Edits will be requested in your document, and it is better to embrace them than to fight them throughout the life of your document. Five easy steps ensure you know what you want from edits and your document:

1. Be clear about your vision.
2. Choose editors to match what you need.
3. Expose your flaws.
4. Use Edits to gain insights.
5. Apply the insights to your rewrite.

If you know your vision, you won't have any problem making edits which might end up misleading the direction of your writing. The various editors available will mean you need to find the right kind of edditor you need. A few kinds of edits would be:

- Idea Development: This individual would try to push you to get an idea and then push on why that idea works. If you can defend your idea, then you can write about it.
- Structural Edit: This edit will ensure your writing is structured properly and the layout of your document works.
- Paragraph or Line Edit: if the structure works then you want to see if the paragraph and sentence flow works.
- Copy edit and Fact-Check: You want to ensure you don't have any grammatical errors or spelling errors, so you need a copy edit. A fact-checker will ensure statements you make are factual.
- Proof read: sometimes all you need is just someone to proof read your document to ensure any small or odd errors don't make it into the final copy.

Exposing your flaws give you something to grow from and learn from. When given an edit you can gain insights in order to learn what your document is lacking instead of what needs to be changed. Every suggested edit is a point of learning. These learnings can be applied back into your writing through a rewrite. It is important to note that not every edit is needed and it is up to you to either take it, learn from the edit and modify what the editor wanted, or reject the edit entirely with a good defense.

## Chapter 19 - Edit Effectively

If you're the editor or you're doing a self edit, there are a few things to keep in mind:

- What stage is this at?: Be sure not to line edit if you're doing structural edits, and ensure the edits needed are in the correct phase.
- What are you worried about?: Figure out what the writer is worried about or not working and have an attention for that section.
- What's your deadline?: Be sure to edit within the timeframe so the writer has plenty of time to fix the edits.
- Why me?: Try to ensure you're editing to the best of your ability so that the writer can get the most out of asking you to edit.

When you edit, make sure to read everything you're given so you can give proper advice. First impressions, areas to cut, and any weasel words, jargon, passive voice, etc. When presenting these edits be sure to stack the suggestions in a sandwich. Mention something nice about what you read, suggest an edit, and then mention something nice again in order to ease the individual into your suggestion. This ensures you can be direct but not on the offensive. A few areas to dig into when editing are:

- Writing Too Long
- Author has Buried the Lede
- Passive Voice Sentences
- Too Much Jargon
- Too Many Weasel Words
- Writing Lacks Clear Advice
- Imprecise Use of Numbers
- Lack of Structure and Skimmability
- It's Not Clear Why the Piece Even Exists
- There's No Central Idea
- Writing Is Choppy
- Writing is a pastiche

## Chapter 20 - Understand Containers

It is important to know what you're writing for and understand the container you're writing in. Some examples would be an email, memo, report, social media post, and others. Each one has a different style, layout, audience, etc. It is important to have a ROAM statement for each one of these mediums no matter how small your writing.

## Chapter 21 - Email Thoughtfully

It is easy to send an email, as many individuals and companies do every day. It is hard to make a meaningful email that individuals will read. Failing to do so will leave your email without a response and deleted. Often times an email is not necessary. If it is, a good first step to building an email is to figure out your ROAM statement:

- Readers: Emails are targeting a specific group of people and it is important to send only to those individuals the email concerns, rather than a much larget group. Do not use Bcc or Cc, email your individuals directly.
- Objective: Know if you need answers or just need to spread information and be clear on what you're sharing and why
- Action: Ensure you tell your readers what you want them to do, whether that is to just be informed or respond with a specific response.
- iMpression: Make sure people can tell you're doing your job and leaves a positive impression in the office.

Once you have a solid ROAM statement, figure out the format of your email. Here are some pointers:

- A subject line that's clear about what you need: the subject line should tell the reader exactly what your email concerns.
- A microwave greeting: make sure the greeting is short, simple, and to the point.
- A one-sentence summary: Your summary should describe what you're emailing about without beating around the bush.
- The facts, on one topic only, structured for browsing: Your email should tackle one subject, and do it well. The subject should be structured in such a way as to be easy to refer back to. Bullets, list, numberings, and graphics should be provided to make the facts easier to find.
- The call to action with a deadline: If the reader needs to act they need to be aware of how long they have to act by in case they're currently busy.
- Thank you, and goodbye: Once you complete the email, say thank you and end the email. Do not drag on the goodbye.

Marketing emails especially need help, as so many are sent in a calendar year and so few are opened and even fewer are actually acted upon. Some tips to ensure individuals see your marketing emails:

- Use a short, descriptive subject line: be as short and to the point as possible to get the attention of your target audience.
- Keep the text short: write as few sentences as possible to describe your email, if you need any at all.
- Write like a person: individuals don't want to think they're being spammed by a robot or listen to marketers. Speak directly to your audience and as part of a team.
- Use small graphics or images, but only if they're relevant: an image can help you sell your product to the audience you're writing to.
- Don't wear out your welcome: Once you've said your peace, end the email and send. Spamming too often too soon will find your emails unsubscribed from or in spam.

If you're in a managerial position, there is help you can get too on writing effective emails:

- Email your people regularly: ensure keeping pace at once a quarter or monthly emails.
- Keep each missive under 400 words: stick to one topic and keep it short and simple to ensure your emails are both read and understood rather than skimmed or ignored.
- Don't bury the lede: tell what you what to tell and don't hide your purpose.
- Dump the management-speak: Speak directly to your audience in a language they understand to help ensure the point gets across.
- Get edits from somebody who will stand up to you: if people are afraid to tell you the truth then you will set yourself up for failure. Find someone who will tell you how your email sounds honestly.

Emailing in a business environment is straight forward enough. Be business casual with your emails. Polite, to the point, and not 'dolled up'. Write your emails on your computer, rather than on a phone where they will get read. Your computer has the editing tools you need. Respect the hierarchy of your business and who the bosses are, as you don't want to tell your bosses what they should be doing. Some final tips are:

- Read the most recent message first: if someone solves a problem, leave it, otherwise read and respond.
- Get in the habit of replying only to the sender: don't reply all and respect everyone's time.
- If you have nothing to say, say nothing: Self explanatory
- If no answer is required, say nothing: Also self explanatory
- If you have an answer to a question, be brief: state the answer you need to and don't drag on. Respect the readers time to let them know what they need to do and nothing more.
- And finally, consider just talking to people: it is easier and simpler to just have a conversation than a long email chain. Speak in person, through video conference, or on a phone, but this solution is often easier than an email.

## Chapter 22 - Master Social Media

Leveraging social media can help you reach your audience appropriatly. Use the containers available to you to reach those audiences. When blogging, you'll want a roam statement considering:

- Readers: potential and current customers
- Objective: to make those customers smarter.
- Action: readers should subscribe to your blog, share it, and check out your products
- iMpression: readers should think of your company as expert and helpful

To help you out your ROAM statement, use these ideas:

- Cue up a few ideas: The first blog post won't hit, but if you have multiple ideas lined up you'll have a better chance of hitting your audience.
- Pick a location that fits your audience and frequency: If you're writing a business blog, linkedin is a good place to go. If you're writing an informative article, Medium might be the way to go. Write to your medium.
- Spend extra time on titles and first sentences: There are a lot of blogs and places to write these days, so catching your audience quickly is key.
- Deliver meaty, structured content: use all the previous tips in the book to create well created content.
- Include a graphic worth sharing: ensure that you provide a great image that can be shared out of context and provides a link back to your document.
- Promote on social media: Post links to your blog on various social media accounts to spread your content.
- Listen and respond: Interact with your audience. Respond to their questions and comments.
- Think of SEO . . . last: You need content worth searching for, so optimize for search engines last.

Social media on the other hand would have the follow ROAM statement:

- Readers: your public following
- Objective: get these followers to embrace a message
- Action: share and click
- iMpression: you're worth following

Your social media needs dictate where you should go. LinkedIn is more professional while Twitter is for quick thoughts. Tumblr is accessible for younger individuals and current pop culture. Ensure you target the right social media outlet for your audience. Sometimes what you need to write is most easily handled in messenger. Some tips when messaging would be:

- Reconsider messaging at all: It could be easier to email or speak in person.
- Message down or across but generally not up: Don't message bosses directly if you can avoid it.
- Avoid group texts: group texts can be annoying and messy, so individually message if you can.
- Request an answer: A good quick message is just asking for clarification or for an answer.
- Choose the right medium: texts and messaging are good for friends, and work messaging systems are good for messaging colleagues. Keep your audience in mind.
- Get right to the point: don't ask to ask a question. Get right to it.
- Use links and photos where they make sense: Send what you need to where appropriate. Images or links for your questions or articles of interest.
- Avoid text-speak and emojis: no smiley faces or short talk.
- Get off as quick as you got on: make your messages short and to the point.

Where possible, make professional contacts with individuals. Keep your social presence growing and grow your network. A few tips for growing your communication channels:

- Be positive and professional: With tools to mass communicate, anyone can see if youre unprofessional and extremely negative.
- Keep requests and answers short: Similarly to write short, keep your posts short. Everyone is reading and responding to someone else. Keep your content short enough to ensure their attentions.
- Share files for longer information: If you're able to send files to help share more content, do so.
- Start new groups and spaces only if you can maintain them: There is no point creating a space for individuals if it isn't going to be maintained.

## Chapter 23 - Promote Intelligently

Press releases are important parts of larger companies. Self promoting are integral parts to showing what a company has been and continues to do. Things NOT to do in a press release:

- The parade of super-duper superlatives: Speaking on how great, awesome, and all other adjectives your company is further obscures purpose.
- The generic meaningless quote: large superficial quotes of how a company is changing the world doesn't change opinions.
- The syrup of industry jargon poured over everything: using an excessive amount of jargin obscures purpose. Don't use them.
- The obligatory boilerplate disclaimer that undermines the whole release: Disclaimers in press conferences make the extravagent press conferences pointless if none of it matters.

A ROAM statement to write a better press release would be:

- Readers: anyone who can spread the word
- Objective: positive sentiment
- Action: spread the word
- iMpression: the PR person is valuable

With a ROAM statement in mind, here are some further means of writing a great public release:

- Write directly in the voice of the spokesperson: Don't use a passive voice. Write directly to your audience as if you're the one saying it.
- Put the news in the title: if you want people to share it, then make the title worth it.
- Explain what you did and why it is important: Press releases tell what you've been been doing and what the product or accomplishment you completed is supposed to help.
- Use as many facts as possible: cite your growth, development, success, all in numbers and as fact.
- Write it in an easily accessible fashion to maximize spread: Write it like a conversation that you can spread in an email.

## Chapter 24 - Craft Actionable Reports

When writing reports, you want to make sure your audience knows what to do with them. Start with a ROAM statement:

- Readers: decision makers interested in a topic
- Objective: make people smarter
- Action: make informed decisions
- iMpression: the author is worth supporting

Your reports should focus on a few key parts. The title and subtile should be, as usual, quick to grab your attention. Executive summaries should be quick and to the point, with all the facts. The setup which creates tension, and an analysis which resolves that tension with knowledge. Recommendations on what to do with the discoveries and the end matter which should convince you what to do and back up all the analytics.
